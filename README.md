# Predictive-Model-Coca-Cola
Predictive Model of Soft Drink Marketing - a volunteer POC project and for learning purposes for a marketing business

Purpose of this predictive model was to predict the amount of Coca-Cola cans sold based on competitors (soft-drink companies) spending on advertising on different platforms (tv, social media, radio, etc). The model was validated against real data.

# Tools & Methodologies

Relevant tools and methods that have been utilised for this project:

* Programs:  R Studios (modelling), LaTeX (report write-up), MatLab, Excel (original data format in csv)
* Basic statistical analytics
     * Extended Simple Linear Model - Multiple Regression (weighted least squares)
     * Coefficients (t-value, Pr > |T|, intercepts, etc)
     * Diagnostics Plotting (choice of fit - residuals and Q-Q)
     * Performance measurements - residuals, R Squared, F-statistic

* Predictive Analytics (modelling)
     * Building the model 
        * Train.data and test.data (80%|20%)
